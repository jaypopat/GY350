    <h2>Kubla Khan</h2>
    <p id ="p1" onclick = "changeColor()" style="color:red;">
      In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>
      A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
      Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
      Through caverns measureless to man<br>
      Down to a sunless sea. 
    </p>
    <p id ="p2"style="color:green;">
      So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
      With walls and towers were girdled round;<br>
      And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
      Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>
      And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
      Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. 
    </p>
    <p id ="p3" style="color:green;">
      But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
      Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br>
      A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br>
      As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
      By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br>
      And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br>
      As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing.
