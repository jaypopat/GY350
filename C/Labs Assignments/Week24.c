//Adventure Game 2 but using dynamic memory allocation
/*Extend last week’s ”Galway Adventure” assignment to now include objects which you
can TAKE and DROP.
• After typing TAKE or DROP, your program should ask
for the object’s name
• An object can only be taken if it’s in the current
location
• An object can only be dropped if it’s in the player’s
inventory
• You can start with your own code or with the
solution to last week’s work which I provided in
class
• Whenever the current location is displayed, a
list of objects at the location should also be
displayed.
• The command INVENTORY should display a list
of whatever the player is holding
• The command EXAMINE should display the
description of the requested object (only if it is
in the current location or player’s inventory)*/
